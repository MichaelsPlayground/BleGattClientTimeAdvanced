# Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Sample Gatt Client

The code is based on an article series found here:

- 1 Bluetooth LE Gatt Example, step-by-step http://android-er.blogspot.com/2016/06/bluetooth-le-gatt-example-step-by-step.html
- 2 Bluetooth LE Gatt Example, scan BLE devices http://android-er.blogspot.com/2016/06/bluetooth-le-gatt-example-scan-ble.html
- 3 Scan specified BLE devices with ScanFilter http://android-er.blogspot.com/2016/06/scan-specified-ble-devices-with.html
- 4 Bluetooth LE example - connect to Bluetooth LE device and display GATT Services http://android-er.blogspot.com/2016/07/bluetooth-le-example-connect-to.html

It runs on Android 12 (SDK32) and for testing you need a companion device or real BLE device.
